### Love

> The first mantra is: "Darling. I'm here for you." When you love someone the
> best thing you can offer him or her is your presence.
> How can you love if you are not there?'

### Philosophy

> Keep your identity small.

- Paul Graham, http://paulgraham.com/identity.html

> You're under no obligation to be the same person you were 5 minutes ago.

> One who wishes to believe says, "Does the evidence permit me to believe?"
> One who wishes to disbelieve asks, "Does the evidence force me to believe?"
> Beware lest you place huge burdens of proof only on propositions you
> dislike, and then defend yourself by saying: "But it is good to be
> skeptical." If you attend only to favorable evidence, picking and choosing
> from your gathered data, then the more data you gather, the less you know.
> If you are selective about which arguments you inspect for flaws, or how
> hard you inspect for flaws, then every flaw you learn how to detect makes
> you that much stupider.

> If the sky is blue
>     I desire to believe that the sky is blue.

> Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want.

- A Litany of Tarski

> Do not assume that categories interesting-to-humans are the ontological
